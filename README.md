## Arihant-MiniProj-CS19B048

The repository contains  my submissions for the mini-project for the **CVI sub-module** of the Software module, **Team Arihant - CFI, IITM**. The overall experience was full of challenges and it was a great experience trying to figure my way out of them. I can confidently say that doing this mini-project has greatly increased my overall practical skill in Deep learning Applications using **Tensorflow** and **Keras**.

The following are the files present in this repository:  
1.  **Count_sheets.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook to apply image preocessing on a given image to easily count the number of sheets  
2.  **Count_Sheets_img.png** - image after applying image processing (easy to count sheets)  
3.  **Create_Train_Test.py** - python code used to randomly split images into test and train sets  
4.  **Image_Classifier.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook with the Deep Learning Model that is used to classify images into 6 classes  

Thanks for the wonderful questions
