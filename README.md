# Arihant-MiniProj-CS19B048

The repository contains  my submissions for the mini-project for the CVI sub-module of the Software module, Team Arihant - CFI, IITM. The overall experience was full of challenges and it was a great experience trying to figure my way out of them. I can confidently say that doing this mini-project has greatly increased my overall practical skill in Deep learning Applications using tensorflow and keras.  
Thanks for the wonderful questions!
